Script logconvert.py scans log file from Hotnest datalogger and converts raw
values from sensors into human readable format. 
Timestamps (first column in raw file) could be converted when you provide start 
and end time for your measurement. It could be easily done in loglegend.txt file.
The line should include file name (for file with raw data, without ".RAW" extention), 
start datetime and end datetime values tab delimited.

Then you can run logconvert script like this:

 ./logconvert.py -f 2010-02-20

Or you can provide all needed options in command line:

 ./logconvert.py -f 2010-02-20 -s "2010-02-20 22:45:23" -e "2010-02-21 11:19:06" -c True
