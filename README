= FillEEPROM.pde =
FillEEPROM.pde is a sketch that allows to scan address of a sensor (DS18B20 returns 8 bytes 
as a unique address) and write it into EEPROM. It saves program memory we need for 
other stuff. :)

= Farm =
This part will include server side script to accept data from serial port (USB) and log it 
into files (or database).
